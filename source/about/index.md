### Hey This is Abdo
Thanks for being here! I’m Abdelrahman Magdy, also known as magdy3660. As a senior Computer Science student with a deep passion for offensive security, I spend my free time focused on penetration testing, uncovering vulnerabilities, and sharing my experiences through CTF write-ups and exploit analysis.
I’m always eager to learn and dive deeper into the field, continuously pushing myself to improve. Along the way, I work hard to overcome impostor syndrome by giving my all to everything I do.
I hope you find my content interesting and informative. I look forward to sharing more with you in the future.
